<b> Cricket </b> grew out of many <i> stick - and - ball games</i> played in <b> England 500 years ago </b> ,under <br>
a variety of different roles.The word <b> "bat" </b> is an old English word that simply means<br>
<b>stick or club </b> . By the <i> seventeenth Century </i> Cricket had evolved enough to be <i> recognisable </i><br>
as a distinct game and it was popular enough <b> for its fans to be fined for playing it on </b> <br>
<i> Sundays instead of going to Church .</i>  Till the middle of the <b>eighteen century</b>, <b> bats </b> were <br>
roughly the same shape as <b> hockey sticks</b> , <body text = "blue">curving towards at the bottom .There was a <br>
simple reason for this : the ball was bowled <b> underarm </b> , along the ground and the curve at<br>
<br> the end bat gave the <b> Batsman </b> the best chance of making contact .
